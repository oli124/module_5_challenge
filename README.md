Generate tables and figures needed for the technical report relating to Pypharmaceuticals, Inc. clinical study.

Produce a range of data analysis and visualisations to analyse the efficacy of a range of drug regimens' (and one placebo's) ability to reduce tumour volumes in both male and female mice over a 45 day period, collected in 5 day increments.

The data comes from two csv files:
  1. Mouse_metadata.csv
  2. Study_results.csv

Any specimens with duplicated or otherwise inconsistent data points were identified and removed.

A range of visualisations were used to best communicate teh different findings of the study.

In addition, key observations and insights can be found at the beginning of the notebook.
